## Features
### Digital Projects Catalog
Component provides the creation and operation of digital projects catalog (programs, files, scripts, extensions, modules, etc.) and allows you to manage their description, characteristics and provides the ability of downloads.

### Versioning
Component provides versioning of digital projects with the ability to specify the stability (Development, Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate, Stable) and changelog management.

### Statistical functionality
Component includes statistical functionality with ability to track the count of downloads for each specific version.
